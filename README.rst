Some of the better bits of mathematical work that I have done on my own for fun.

Any errors are wholly my own. This repository will alwasy be a work in progress,
but will usually likely see few updates, as most topics are not substantial
enough to do a full article on. Article topics will most likely fall within the
categories of financial math or statistical learning, which are my main
recreational interests.
