% So far, the TeX files in exercises that have my worked solutions to various
% textbook exercises all have introductions explaining why I picked up the
% book and so on. This file is used to standardize the closing transition
% paragraph used before starting the actual exercise sections.
%
% Typical usage is by using \input as follows:
%
%   % standardized closing transition
%   \input{../utils/intro_close}
%
% The path used might change depending on directory structure refactoring.

Regardless, the worked exercises in this document exist as a testament to my
own efforts towards understanding and will hopefully be a resource to
anyone else who may be attempting these exercises.

        self-learning truly plays an outsized role in determining the depth of
        one's understanding. One's instructors are there to guide and support,
        but all must walk their paths to understanding themselves.%
